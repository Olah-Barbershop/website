- Maybe I should add our [Threads](https://threads.net/@olahbarbershop). I'll think about it

# Running, building

First, clone the site
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Olah-Barbershop/website
cd website
```

Next, install the dependencies (assuming you have Node.js>=18 installed)
```sh
npm install
```

Now, you can either run the site in development mode
```sh
npm run dev -- --open 
```

Or build it into a static site
```sh
npm run build
```

And preview it in your browser
```sh
npm run preview -- --open
```

**IMPORTANT** If you're building the site, and **not** serving it from your root directory, you must create a `.env` file before building and add the absolute path that your build is served from, e.g. "/website" if you're serving from example.com/website
```env
BASE_PATH=<Your path>
```
